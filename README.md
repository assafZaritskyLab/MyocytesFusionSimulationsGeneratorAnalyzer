# MyocytesFusionSimulationsGeneratorAnalyzer
Myoblast fusion is essential for muscle development and regeneration in multiple organisms, including flies and humans.
Inorder to verify the hypothesis of synchronized fusion (compared to randomly occurring fusion), we devised simulations that are parameterized by a true experiment's meta-data (such as initial cell/nuclei count, number of fusions in each timeframe, etc.) and "fuse cells" according to a given policy.
Two policies are currently implemented (random fusion and weighted by nuclei No.), but the OOP strategy pattern we utilized allows for easy implementation of numerous more policies.
All results are compared to true experiments data and significance level is calculated according to a modified bootstrapping technique. all results are saved 
in the root folder of the source code.
